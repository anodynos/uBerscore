# uBerscore v0.0.8

An anorthodox, extensible, overloaded, highly experimental facade of *underscore* facilities & leftovers.

uBerscore.js is an early experiment: a 'higher' level data manipulator for all kinds of js collections (objects+arrays); it offers functionality that underscore doesn't and wouldn't have, and its highly build on the great `_`.

There will be no documentation before 0.1 and consider it likely to change...
But do see `blending` that powers [uRequire](https://github.com/anodynos/uRequire)'s versatile configuration structure to get some ideas.
Also checkout `go` & the wicked `isEquals/isIquals/isExact` etc.

One thing to note: uBerscore its running on the WEB (both with AMD and as plain `<script/>`) & in nodejs through the UMD conversion / single-file
combination of [uRequire v0.3](https://github.com/anodynos/uRequire)
